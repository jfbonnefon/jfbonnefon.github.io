Here we asked human participants to consider hypothetical cases in which a pedestrian was killed by a car operated under shared control of a primary and a secondary driver and to indicate how blame should be allocated. We find that when only one driver makes an error, that driver is blamed more regardless of whether that driver is a machine or a human. However, when both drivers make errors in cases of human???machine shared-control vehicles, the blame attributed to the machine is reduced. This finding portends a public under-reaction to the malfunctioning artificial intelligence components of automated cars and therefore has a direct policy implication; allowing the de facto standards for shared-control vehicles to be established in courts by the jury system could fail to properly regulate the safety of those vehicles; instead, a top-down scheme (through federal laws) may be called for.","tags":null,"title":"Drivers are blamed more than their automated cars when both make mistakes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["E Salvia","K Mevel","G Borst","N Poirel","G Simon","F Orliac","O Etard","A Hopfensitz","O Houde","JF Bonnefon","W De Neys"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"af4725d5badc33eb74366370ef5518d6","permalink":"/publication/jnpe20/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jnpe20/","section":"publication","summary":"Some economic transactions require people to trust strangers, whose trustworthiness is unknown. In these circumstances, behavioral studies have shown that adults (but not young adolescents) seem to have some minimal ability to detect the trustworthiness of adult strangers based on their facial features. In this study, we explored the neural correlates of this facial trustworthiness detection. A group of adolescents and adults played a series of economic Trust Games with adult trustees of which we had previously recorded the strategy. Results showed that when adult investors were looking at the picture of a trust-abusing trustee, the left amygdala was relatively more activated than when they were looking at a trust-honoring player. Younger adolescents did not show this pattern and responded with a more pronounced deactivation when facing a trust-abusing trustee. An exploratory whole-brain analysis detected a similar age shift for mentalizing regions of the brain. Our results fit with an emerging model suggesting that the amygdala is implicated in an associative learning process that progressively refines a mapping of faces onto trustworthy behavior and may result in avoiding to be exploited by untrustworthy strangers.","tags":null,"title":"Age-related neural correlates of facial trustworthiness detection during economic interaction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M Juanchich","M Sirota","JF Bonnefon"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"c67a5b8500428b47ca1f12ecfc544396","permalink":"/publication/jbdm20/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jbdm20/","section":"publication","summary":"The Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) is among the most common and well‐known instruments for measuring the propensity to engage reflective processing, in the context of the dual‐process theory of high‐level cognition. There is robust evidence that men perform better than women on this test—but we should be wary to conclude that men are more likely to engage in reflective processing than women. We consider several possible loci for the gender difference in CRT performance, and use mathematical modeling to show, across two studies, that the gender difference in CRT performance is more likely due to women making more mathematical mistakes (partially explained by their greater mathematics anxiety) than due to women being less likely to engage reflective processing. As a result, we argue that we need to use gender‐equivalent variants of the CRT, both to improve the quality of our instruments and to fulfill our social responsibility as scientists.","tags":null,"title":"Anxiety-induced miscalculations, more than differential inhibition of intuition, explain the gender gap in cognitive reflection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["E Awad","S Dsouza","JF Bonnefon","A Shariff","I Rahwan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"b9bde0a51d0bbcaff894ff11c1668329","permalink":"/publication/cacm20/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cacm20/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Crowdsourcing moral machines","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M Miranda Lery Santos","A Tricot","JF Bonnefon"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"5f86cf2b950404c31426c783c125c475","permalink":"/publication/tar20/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tar20/","section":"publication","summary":"Why do learners fail to seek help, when doing so would be beneficial? Principles of rational decision suggest that seeking help is not an optimal action if its costs are greater than its expected benefits. Accordingly, learners should be sensitive to three parameters when making the decision to seek help; the benefits of doing so, but also the probability of obtaining these benefits, as well as the intrinsic costs of seeking help. We report three experiments that pitted the financial, temporal, and social costs of help-seeking against its expected benefits. Participants were more likely to seek help when help came at no financial cost, but showed little sensitivity to other parameters. These findings contribute to identify low-priority interventions to improve help-seeking behaviour. Learners may not need reassurance that help will come if they ask, and that they will not waste time by seeking help.","tags":null,"title":"Do learners declining to seek help conform to rational principles?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S Borau","JF Bonnefon"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"a94596b77f71b06face25431bec1062d","permalink":"/publication/jbr20/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jbr20/","section":"publication","summary":"Gendered marketing is a pervasive trend, despite the public controversies it generates. Most of research so far has focused on the socialization-based perspectives of gendered marketing to explain this phenomenon. In this research, we ask the following instrumental question; which benefits can men and women derive from owning gender-typical variants of consumer goods? We propose that gender-typical products can act as the extended phenotype of human sexual dimorphism, broadcasting a cultural equivalent to the signals issued by biological, secondary sexual characteristics. Based on evidence showing that secondary sexual characteristics increase attractiveness and desirability, we predict that gender-typical products increase the attractiveness and desirability of their owners by acting as supernormal stimuli of sexual dimorphism. An internal meta-analysis across three studies confirms that consumers who own gender-typical products are mentally pictured as more physically attractive. We also find that owners of gender-typical products can be perceived as sexier, and more desirable partners.","tags":null,"title":"Gendered products act as the extended phenotype of human sexual dimorphism: They increase physical attractiveness and desirability","type":"publication"},{"authors":["I Rahwan","J Crandall","JF Bonnefon"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"7967c6e24935cad213d79b33a6e091c2","permalink":"/publication/pnas20comment/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pnas20comment/","section":"publication","summary":"Some people excel at facilitating communication between other people.

In these new domains, people have the possibility to opt out of using a machine, if they do not approve of the ethics that the machine is programmed to follow. In other words, even if normative ethics could determine the best moral programs, these programs would not be adopted (and thus have no positive impact) if they clashed with users' preferences— a phenomenon that we label the 'Ethical Opt-Out.' The chapter then explores various ways in which the field of moral psychology can illuminate public perception of moral AI, and inform the regulations of such AI.

Cross-cultural studies suggested a complex pattern of universals and variations in the way people approach this question, but data were often based on small samples from a small num- ber of countries outside of the Western world. Here we analyze responses to three sacrificial dilemmas by 70,000 participants in 10 languages and 42 countries. In every country, the three dilemmas displayed the same qualitative ordering of sacrifice acceptability, suggesting that this ordering is best explained by basic cognitive processes rather than cultural norms. The quantitative acceptability of each sacrifice, however, showed substantial country-level variations. We show that low relational mobility (where people are more cautious about not alienating their current social partners) is strongly associated with the rejection of sacrifices for the greater good (especially for Eastern countries), which may be explained by the signaling value of this rejection.

Such technologies have drawn sharp criticism due to their ethical implications, and have fueled a push towards transparency in human–machine interactions. Despite the legitimacy of these concerns, it remains unclear whether bots would compromise their efficiency by disclosing their true nature. Here, we conduct a behavioural experiment with participants playing a repeated prisoner’s dilemma game with a human or a bot, after being given either true or false information about the nature of their associate. We find that bots do better than humans at inducing cooperation, but that disclosing their true nature negates this superior efficiency. Human participants do not recover from their prior bias against bots despite experiencing cooperative attitudes exhibited by bots over time. These results highlight the need to set standards for the efficiency cost we are willing to pay in order for machines to be transparent about their non-human nature.","tags":null,"title":"Behavioural evidence for a transparency-efficiency tradeoff in human-machine cooperation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"299a077dcf7d88d57edc9080508f2dd4","permalink":"/bio/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/bio/","section":"","summary":"Hello!","tags":null,"title":"Bio","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":["M Derex","JF Bonnefon","R Boyd","A Mesoudi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"0db888aa93bcc9dceca2303483169cfb","permalink":"/publication/nhb19/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/nhb19/","section":"publication","summary":"Bows and arrows, houses and kayaks are just a few examples of the highly optimized tools that humans have produced and used to colonize new environments. Because there is much evidence that humans' cognitive abilities are unparalleled, many believe that such technologies resulted from our superior causal reasoning abilities. However, others have stressed that the high dimensionality of human technologies makes them very difficult to understand causally. Instead, they argue that optimized technologies emerge through the retention of small improvements across generations without requiring understanding of how these technologies work. Here we show that a physical artefact becomes progressively optimized across generations of social learners in the absence of explicit causal understanding. Moreover, we find that the transmission of causal models across generations has no noticeable effect on the pace of cultural evolution. The reason is that participants do not spontaneously create multidimensional causal theories but, instead, mainly produce simplistic models related to a salient dimension. Finally, we show that the transmission of these inaccurate theories constrains learners’ exploration and has downstream effects on their understanding. These results indicate that complex technologies need not result from enhanced causal reasoning but, instead, can emerge from the accumulation of improvements made across generations.","tags":null,"title":"Causal understanding is not necessary for the improvement of culturally evolving technology","type":"publication"},{"authors":["JF Bonnefon"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"fc5a3d0f2e39e8b5370b963c20fe6b3e","permalink":"/publication/hum19/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hum19/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"La voiture qui en savait trop : l'intelligence artificielle a-t-elle une morale ?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["I Rahwan","M Cebrian","N Obradovich","N Bongard","JF Bonnefon","C Breazeal","JW Crandall","NA Christakis","I Couzin","MO Jackson","NR Jennings","E Kamar","I Kloumann","H Larochelle","D Lazer","R McElreath","A Mislove","DC Parkes","A Pentland","ME Roberts","A Shariff","JB Tenenbaum","M Wellman"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"0ab1d42539f5c93e07f50e856fc01594","permalink":"/publication/nature19/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/nature19/","section":"publication","summary":"Machines powered by artificial intelligence increasingly mediate our social, cultural, economic and political interactions.

Across four studies, we investigate the negative consequences of this imaginary competition on consumers' mate-guarding jealousy, indirect aggression, and drive for thinness. A meta-analysis of studies 1–3 shows that women exposed to an idealized model report more mate-guarding jealousy and show increased indirect aggression (i.e., derogation and social exclusion), but do not report a higher desire for thinness. Study 4 replicates these findings and reveals that the main driver of aggression is the sexually provocative attitude of the model (a signal of a flirting behavior and of sexual availability), rather than her thin body size. The ethical implications of these findings for advertising are discussed in light of recent concerns about female bullying, online, and in the workplace.","tags":null,"title":"The imaginary intrasexual competition: Advertisements featuring provocative female models trigger women to engage in indirect aggression","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M Juanchich","M Sirota","JF Bonnefon"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"104d4890ac9cef876127517689534b6d","permalink":"/publication/jbdm19/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jbdm19/","section":"publication","summary":"We extend research on charity donations by exploring an everyday tactic for increasing compliance; asking politely. We consider three possible effects of politeness on charity donations; a positive effect, a negative effect, and a wiggle‐room effect where the perception of the request is adjusted to decline donating without feeling selfish. Results from six experiments systematically supported the polite wiggle‐room effect. In hypothetical donations contexts, indirect requests were judged more polite. In real donation contexts, though, indirect requests were not judged as more polite and had no consistent effect on donation decision. Rather, the decision to donate predicted the perceived politeness of the request, independently of its phrasing.

Participants assessed the risk of contracting a disease on either a verbal probability scale (Experiment 1) or a numerical probability/frequency scale with immediate (Experiments 2–3) or delayed presentation (Experiments 4–5). Participants also made a health-related decision and completed a health literacy and numeracy scale. The 1-in-X ratios yielded higher probability perceptions than did the N-in-XN ratios and affected relevant decisions. Critically, the 1-in-X ratios led to a larger objective overestimation of numerical probabilities than did the N-in-XN ratios. People with lower levels of health literacy and numeracy were not more sensitive to the bias. Health professionals should use 1-in-X ratios with great caution when communicating to patients, because they overestimate health risks.","tags":null,"title":"1-in-X bias: 1-in-X format causes overestimation of health-related risks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["JW Crandall","M Oudah","Tennom","F Ishowo-Oloko","S Abdallah","JF Bonnefon","M Cebrian","A Shariff","MA Goodrich","I Rahwan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"acc2fd678dd4edb5a39a3ff5d7fd4b34","permalink":"/publication/natcom18/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/natcom18/","section":"publication","summary":"Since Alan Turing envisioned artificial intelligence, technical progress has often been measured by the ability to defeat humans in zero-sum encounters (e.g., Chess, Poker, or Go). Less attention has been given to scenarios in which human–machine cooperation is beneficial but non-trivial, such as scenarios in which human and machine preferences are neither fully aligned nor fully in conflict. Cooperation does not require sheer computational power, but instead is facilitated by intuition, cultural norms, emotions, signals, and pre-evolved dispositions. Here, we develop an algorithm that combines a state-of-the-art reinforcement-learning algorithm with mechanisms for signaling. We show that this algorithm can cooperate with people and other algorithms at levels that rival human cooperation in a variety of two-player repeated stochastic games. These results indicate that general human–machine cooperation is achievable using a non-trivial, but ultimately simple, set of algorithmic mechanisms.","tags":null,"title":"Cooperating with machines","type":"publication"},{"authors":["E Awad","S Dsouza","R Kim","J Schulz","J Henrich","A Shariff","JF Bonnefon","I Rahwan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"9d9b8db559159f5cbc7c3cf058c6afff","permalink":"/publication/nature18/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/nature18/","section":"publication","summary":"With the rapid development of artificial intelligence have come concerns about how machines will make moral decisions, and the major challenge of quantifying societal expectations about the ethical principles that should guide machine behaviour.

This platform gathered 40 million decisions in ten languages from millions of people in 233 countries and territories. Here we describe the results of this experiment. First, we summarize global moral preferences. Second, we document individual variations in preferences, based on respondents' demographics. Third, we report cross-cultural ethical variation, and uncover three major clusters of countries. Fourth, we show that these differences correlate with modern institutions and deep cultural traits.

In this article, I consider the two sides of that claim; Does critical thinking always require system 2 processing? And does system 2 processing always result in critical thinking? I argue that it is plausible and helpful to consider that critical thinking requires system 2 processing. In particular, this assumption can provide interesting insights and benchmarks for critical thinking education. On the other hand, I show that system 2 processing can result in a range of outcomes which are either contradictory with critical thinking, or of debatable social desirability—which suggests that there is more to critical thinking than mere system 2 processing, and more to system 2 processing than just critical thinking.","tags":null,"title":"The pros and cons of identifying critical thinking with System 2 processing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["JF Bonnefon","A Hopfensitz","W De Neys"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"a92fa95b3027f3b02791437d628a25c1","permalink":"/publication/cdips17/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cdips17/","section":"publication","summary":"Humans are willing to cooperate with each other for mutual benefit???and to accept the risk of exploitation.

This literature suggests that people can detect cooperativeness with a small but significant degree of accuracy when they have interacted with or watched video clips of other players, but that they have a harder time extracting information from pictures.

Different mechanisms have been implemented to capture these opinions such as Like in Facebook, Favorite in Twitter, thumbs-up/-down, flagging, and so on. However, in more contested domains (e.g., Wikipedia, political discussion, and climate change discussion), these mechanisms are not sufficient, since they only deal with each issue independently without considering the relationships between different claims. We can view a set of conflicting arguments as a graph in which the nodes represent arguments and the arcs between these nodes represent the defeat relation. A group of people can then collectively evaluate such graphs. To do this, the group must use a rule to aggregate their individual opinions about the entire argument graph. Here we present the first experimental evaluation of different principles commonly employed by aggregation rules presented in the literature. We use randomized controlled experiments to investigate which principles people consider better at aggregating opinions under different conditions. Our analysis reveals a number of factors, not captured by traditional formal models, that play an important role in determining the efficacy of aggregation.

Accordingly, reading should be disrupted when a protagonist avoids an action with desirable consequences, but reading should not be disrupted when a protagonist takes an action with undesirable consequences.

For the purpose of teasing apart the different components underpinning scene construction in the two experiences of recalling episodic memories and shaping novel future events, we used a paradigm that might selectively affect one of these components (i.e., the spatial).

To create the scenarios, we varied (a) retributive justice???the amount of remuneration; (b) procedural justice???the clarity of the procedure that determined the remuneration; (c) distributive justice???the extent of the distribution of bonus payments amongst employees; and (d) restorative justice???a special compensation for hazardous working conditions or accidents at work.

Here, we investigate social learning in the context of the uniquely human capacity for reflective, analytical reasoning. A hallmark of the human mind is its ability to engage analytical reasoning, and suppress false associative intuitions. Through a set of laboratory-based network experiments, we find that social learning fails to propagate this cognitive strategy. When people make false intuitive conclusions and are exposed to the analytic output of their peers, they recognize and adopt this correct output. But they fail to engage analytical reasoning in similar subsequent tasks. Thus, humans exhibit an \"unreflective copying bias\"\", which limits their social learning to the output, rather than the process, of their peers' reasoning—even when doing so requires minimal effort and no technical skill. In contrast to much recent work on observation-based social learning, which emphasizes the propagation of successful behaviour through copying, our findings identify a limit on the power of social networks in situations that require analytical reasoning.","tags":null,"title":"Analytical reasoning task reveals limits of social learning in networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["B Tremoliere","JF Bonnefon"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"9c925bcc8223d831e8ebb0a4b4d2aeab","permalink":"/publication/pspb14/","publishdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pspb14/","section":"publication","summary":"The dual-process model of moral judgment postulates that utilitarian responses to moral dilemmas (e.g., accepting to kill one to save five) are demanding of cognitive resources.

The quantitative model uses a crude probabilistic definition, arguably the common core of more sophisticated quantitative definitions; the qualitative model uses a definition based on nonmonotonic consequence relations.

A doctrinal paradox occurs when majority voting on a compound proposition (such as a conjunction or disjunction) yields a different result than majority voting on each of the elements of the proposition. For example, when most individuals accept proposition X ; most individuals accept proposition Y ; but only a minority of individuals accept the compound proposition \"X and Y\". Conducting two elemental votes would lead to accept X and Y, but conducting one compound vote would lead to reject X and Y. In such a situation, do people manifest a stable preference as to which voting procedure should be applied? This research reports the results of two behavioral experiments using a within-participant design, which show that procedural preferences can be upturned by framing either positively or negatively the set of judgments to be aggregated.

Furthermore, results show that floating reinstatement yields comparable effects to that of simple reinstatement, thus arguing in favor of preferred argumentation semantics, rather than grounded argumentation semantics.

Although causality is generally regarded as transitive, some philosophers have questioned this assumption, and models of causality in artificial intelligence are often agnostic with respect to transitivity. They define causation, then check whether the definition makes all, or only some, causal arguments transitive. We consider two formal models of observation-based causation, which differ in the way they represent uncertainty. The quantitative model uses a standard probabilistic definition; the qualitative model uses a definition based on nonmonotonic consequence. The two models identify different sufficient conditions for the transitivity of causation -- The Markov condition on events for the quantitative model, and a Saliency condition (if B is true then generally A is true) for the qualitative model. We explore the formal relations between these sufficient conditions, and between the underlying definitions of observation-based causation.

This shift in emphasis, from the modal performance to variations in performance, raises some methodological concerns about the reliability and validity of the scores obtained when measuring reasoning performance. Differences in these scores might reflect measurement errors or reactions to pragmatic and semantic contextualization rather than differences in reasoning ability. This article shows how latent state-trait modeling can be applied to the responses collected in standard reasoning experiments. A latent state-trait analysis of contrapositive reasoning (if p then q; not-q; what follows?) revealed that the variables used to assess contrapositive reasoning ability showed remarkably good reliability and are only weakly affected by situation-specific influences. Consequently, they are appropriate for assessing stable interindividual differences in abilities. Moreover, the hypothesis of the existence of a general task-independent reasoning ability has to be rejected because the different task-specific abilities are only moderately correlated (between .27 and .63).","tags":null,"title":"Modeling individual differences in contrapositive reasoning with continuous latent state and trait variables","type":"publication"},{"authors":["JF Bonnefon","G Villejoubert"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1167609600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1167609600,"objectID":"d4fa1c6297c22d3fbfe0cebd7b2563aa","permalink":"/publication/tar07/","publishdate":"2007-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tar07/","section":"publication","summary":"The utterance of a negative statement invites the pragmatic inference that some reason exists for the proposition it negates to be true; this pragmatic inference paves the way for the logically unexpected Modus Shmollens inference 'If p then q; not-q; therefore, p.'
